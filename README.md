# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Machine Learning classifier. It also includes explainability (SHAP) and a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news spreads misinformation and can cause widespread panic or manipulation. This project uses **TF-IDF** vectorization and **Logistic Regression** to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Binary classification of news (Real or Fake)
- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
- ✅ TF-IDF vectorization for text
- ✅ Trained using Logistic Regression
- ✅ Model & vectorizer saved using `joblib`
- ✅ SHAP Explainability integrated
- ✅ Streamlit UI for live predictions
